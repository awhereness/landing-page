	<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Awhereness is sensitive to the privacy concerns of visitors to its website. The purpose of this General Online Privacy Policy is to describe what types of personal information we collect from visitors to the website, the purposes for which we use the information, what rights you have regarding your personal information, and to whom and under what circumstances we disclose your personal information. This Privacy Policy applies to our information collection, use, and disclosure practices for website visitors.</p>
<h2>Collection of Personal Information</h2>
<p>You can browse some of the website without telling us who you are or otherwise transmitting personal information. In order to use certain features of the website, you are required to register and provide certain personal information. If you chose to give us personal information, you consent to the transfer and storage of that information on servers located in the United States. We may collect and store the following personal information: name, email address, date of birth, The Awhereness user name, voter registration number, residence address, and correspondence sent to us; and standard web log information, such as connection information, statistics on page views, traffic to and from our site, ad data, and IP addresses.</p>

<h3>How You Can Protect Your Account</h3>

<p>Your password is your key to your account. Use unique numbers, letters and special characters, and do not share your password with anyone. If you do share your password or your personal information with others, remember that you are responsible for all actions taken on your account. If you lose control of your password, you may lose substantial control over your personal information and may subject to legally binding actions taken on your behalf. Therefore, if your password has been compromised for any reason, you should immediately notify us and change your password.</p>

<h3>How You Can Access, Review, or Change Your Personal Information</h3>

<p>You can see, review, and change your personal information via your account tab. You must promptly update your personal information if it changes or is inaccurate. Other internet sites you visit, including those linked from our website, may have their own privacy policies or no policy at all. Other websites might use personal information differently than our policy permits. We strongly encourage you to review the privacy policies of any site before providing any personal information.</p>

<h2>DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION</h2>

<p>We may disclose personal information if we are legally required to do so, to enforce our policies, to respond to claims that content you submitted violates the rights of others, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of third parties. We may also share your personal information with: entities or individuals that perform functions on our behalf, including, but not limited to technical service providers who help us with our business operations; third parties to whom you expressly agree to share your information with; and law enforcement or other government officials, in response to a verified request relating to a criminal investigation or alleged illegal activity (we will disclose information relevant to the investigation). </p>

<h2>SECURITY OF INFORMATION</h2>

<p>Your information is stored on servers located in the United States. A combination of authentication procedures is used to maintain the security of your online session and to protect your account and our systems from unauthorized access. All of our employees and our independent contractors/agents must abide by this Privacy Policy. However, third parties may unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications, and may abuse or misuse your personal information that they collect or have unauthorized access to. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your personal information or private communications will always remain private.</p>

<h2>CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY </h2>

<p>By visiting our website, you are agreeing to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. On occasion, it may be necessary for us to change the terms of the Privacy Policy. We will do so by posting updated text on this website, and your continued use constitutes acceptance of those changes. To ensure that you are aware of current privacy practices, we recommend that you check this website periodically. We will not materially change how we handle previously collected information without providing notice and an opportunity to choose how we use that information.</p>
